## 🚀 New Features

### 1. Dedicated Holdings Page
- **Separate View**: Moved the detailed holdings table from the Dashboard to its own dedicated `/holdings` page for a focused experience.
- **Groupable Table**: Introducing a powerful **"Group By"** feature. You can now organize your portfolio by:
    - **AMC** (Fund House) e.g., *SBI Mutual Fund, Axis Mutual Fund*
    - **Asset Class** e.g., *Equity, Debt, Hybrid*
    - **Category** e.g., *Large Cap, Liquid Fund*
- **Accordion UI**: Groups are collapsible with **Smart Headers** that display the aggregated **Invested Amount** and **Current Value** for that specific group.

### 2. Advanced Asset Allocation
- **Three-Chart Dashboard**: The dashboard now features a comprehensive 3-column layout:
    - **Asset Allocation**: Breakdown by Equity vs. Debt.
    - **Category Allocation**: Breakdown by Market Cap / Sector.
    - **AMC Allocation**: Breakdown by Fund House.
- **Enhanced Legends**: Charts now display precise percentage values directly in the legend (e.g., *Equity (85.2%)*).
- **Dashboard Filtering**: New **"Filter By"** dropdown allows you to instantly toggle the entire dashboard view between **All**, **SIP Only**, and **Lumpsum Only**. Analyze the performance of your SIPs separately from your Lumpsum investments.

### 3. Portfolio XIRR
- **True Performance Metric**: Added **XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return)** to the Dashboard KPI cards.
- **Smart Tooltip**: Hovering over the XIRR percentage explains the calculation method (Newton-Raphson), ensuring you understand your true annualized returns considering all SIP & Lumpsum timings.

## 🛠 Improvements & Fixes

### Data Robustness
- **Database-Driven Grouping**: Migrated from fragile frontend string parsing to a robust backend solution. `Fund House` and `Category` data is now fetched directly from **mfapi.in** and stored in the database.
- **Auto-Migration**: The system now automatically checks and updates your database schema on startup, ensuring smooth upgrades without manual SQL scripts.

### UI/UX Polish
- **Custom Dropdowns**: Replaced native select inputs with themed, custom-built dropdowns for a premium feel on the Holdings page.
- **Decluttered Dashboard**: Removed the redundant "Holdings" table from the main dashboard to prioritize high-level KPIs and Charts.
- **Smart Fallbacks**: Implemented intelligent fallback logic for AMC names to ensure clean grouping even before a full sync.
