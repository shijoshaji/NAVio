## 🚀 New Features

### 1. Realised P&L Tracking
- **Sold Status**: You can now mark funds as "Sold" to archive them while retaining their history.
- **Performance Metrics**: Sold items display "Realised Value" and "Realised P&L" (Net Profit) instead of current market fluctuations.
- **Distinct Visuals**: Sold items are visually distinct with a "SOLD" badge and historical dates.

### 2. Enhanced Watchlist Groups
- **Active / Sold Tabs**: Each Watchlist Group now has dedicated tabs to toggle between:
  - **Active**: Your current portfolio positions.
  - **Realised (Sold)**: Your historical exits and profits.
- **Portfolio Breakdown**: Group headers now clearly display the count of Active vs. Sold funds (e.g., *"10 Funds Tracking (8 Active · 2 Sold)"*).

### 3. Actionable Dashboard ("All Funds" View)
- **Focused View**: The main "All Funds" dashboard remains streamlined, prioritizing "Actionable Signals" (Dip Buy, Accumulate, Sell Targets).
- **Pagination**: Implemented smart pagination (5 items per page) with navigation controls to handle growing lists smoothly.
- **Interactive Tooltips**: Added hover tooltips to signal badges (e.g., `Dip Buy`, `Target Sell`) explaining the logic behind the recommendation.

## 🛠 Improvements & Fixes

### Smart Re-entry Logic
- **Re-entering Positions**: If you add a fund that you previously sold, the system now intelligently creates a **New Active Entry** instead of overwriting your historical sold record. This allows you to track multiple trade cycles for the same fund.

### Safety & Validation
- **Duplicate Prevention**: The "Add Fund" workflow now checks if the fund is already *active* in the selected group. If it exists, it prevents accidental duplication and prompts you to use the Edit function.

### Visibility Updates
- **New Item Visibility**: Fixed an issue where newly added funds (with 0 investment) were hidden from the Dashboard. They are now always visible to allow for immediate editing.

## 📊 Summary
This update transforms the Watchlist from a static list into a dynamic portfolio tracker that handles the full lifecycle of your investments—from **entry** (Active), through **monitoring** (Actionable Signals & Pagination), to **exit** (Realised P&L).
