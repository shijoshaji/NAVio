## ✨ New Features

### 📉 52-Week High/Low (with Dates)
Gain deeper context on price movements with the new **52-Week High/Low** column.
-   **Price Range**: See the yearly minimum and maximum NAV for every fund.
-   **Timeline Context**: Dates are now included (e.g., `₹197.4 (02 Jan 25)`), helping you spot exactly *when* the fund peaked or bottomed.

### 💰 XIRR Analysis
Real returns for your real investments.
-   **XIRR Toggle**: A new toggle in the header allows you to reveal the **Extended Internal Rate of Return** column.
-   **Why it matters**: Unlike simple absolute returns, XIRR accounts for the timing of your SIPs and irregular investments, giving you the *true* annualised performance.
-   **Smart Tooltip**: Hover over the header to learn how XIRR is calculated vs. absolute profit/loss.

### 📅 Smart Lumpsum Planner
Track your goals with precision in the Lumpsum Tracker.
-   **Holding Period Targets**: Define your target years for each lumpsum investment (e.g., "3 Years" for ELSS or "10 Years" for a goal).
-   **Auto-Redemption Date**: The system automatically calculates and displays the exact redemption date based on your holding period.
-   **Redeem Status**: In the Holdings view, see instantly if an investment is **Active** (Idle), **Near Maturity**, or ready to **Redeem**.

### 🏷️ SIP Indicators
-   **Smart Badging**: funds with active or past Systematic Investment Plans are now instantly recognizable with a distinctive **"SIP"** badge next to their name.

## 🛠️ UI & UX Enhancements

-   **Table Sorting**:
    -   **Click to Sort**: Every column header (Scheme, Date, Invested, Current, XIRR, 52W H/L) is now clickable.
    -   **Grouped Sorting**: Sorting works intelligently even inside grouped views (e.g., sorting by "Current Value" inside an "AMC" group).
    -   **Visual Feedback**: Clear Up/Down arrow indicators show the active sort order.

-   **Start Investing**: A friendly nudge and empty state when no holdings are found.
